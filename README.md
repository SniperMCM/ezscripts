YES, Javascript DOES have an interval rate, so this may not work if you have any bugs DM me.

HOW TO RETURN YOUR PC INTO NORMAL:
1. quickly exit the tab
2. if the PC is becoming louder and louder IMMEDIATELY shut down and if possible, extinguish.


HOW TO USE:
1. from code.js paste it into a console by CTRL + SHIFT + I
2. watch it happen BUT do so at your own risk
